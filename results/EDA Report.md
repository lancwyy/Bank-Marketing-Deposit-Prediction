### Step 2-3: Inspect Categorical Type Columns for Distinct Values
|Categorical Column|High Cardinality|Dominant Category|Meaningless Value|Temporal Drift|Encoding Inconsistency|Semantic Redundancy|Feature Engineering|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Job|No, 12 distinct values|No, most one accounts for 23%|'Unknown': 0.63%|Not found|Not found|Not found|- One-hot encoding<br>Per biz frame, could consider group some, e.g. management & entrepreneur or group rare jobs into 'other'
|Marital|No, 3 distinct values|Yes, 'married': 56.9%<br>Could be key differentiator|Not found|Not found|Not found|Not found|- One-hot encoding<br>- Binary grouping because 'single' has higher target association.|
|Education|No, 4 distinct values|Yes, 'secondary': 49%<br>Could be key differentiator|Yes, 'unknown':4.45%|Not found|Not found|Not found|- One-hot encoding<br>- Ordinal mapping: unknown < primary < secondary < tertiary|
|Contact|No, 3 distinct values|Yes, 'Cellular': 72%|'Unknown': 21%|Not found|Not found|Not found|- One-hot encoding
|Month|No, 12 distinct values|No, most one accounts for 25%|Not found|Not found|Not found|Not found|- Cyclic encoding<br>Grouping by quarter
|Poutcome|No, 4 distinct values|Yes, 'Unknown': 75%|Yes, 'Other': 5%|Not found|Not found|Not found|- one-hot encoding

### Step 2-4: Inspect Boolean Type Columns for Proportional Visualization
|Boolean Column|Imbalance Flag|Class Imbalance|Feature Engineering|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Default|'False': 98%<br>This is normal case.|'False' has higher deposit rate but < 0.5|No action required|
|Housing|'False': 53%|Yes, 'False' has higher deposit rate > 0.5|No action required|
|Loan|'False': 87%|'False' has higher deposit rate but < 0.5|No action required|


#### <b>Dominant Category with Low Variance (Imbalanced Column)</b>
- Default: 98.5% as no (this is normal as most of people should not be with default credit)
- Loan: 86.9% as no (this is normal as most of people should not be with personal loan)




3. ðŸ“ˆ Interaction Features
Combine 'marital' with other columns like 'education', 'job', or 'poutcome' to capture compound effects

python
df['marital_edu'] = df['marital'] + '_' + df['education']
Useful if 'single_secondary' behaves differently than 'married_secondary'.

4. ðŸ“… Campaign Timing Sensitivity
Create a feature like is_married_in_summer if 'month' shows seasonal variation in deposit behavior by marital status

Could be relevant for financial planning cycles or family budgeting periods.

5. ðŸ“‹ Ordinal Mapping (if justified)
If there's a business rationale (e.g., stability or financial responsibility), map to ordinal scale:

python
marital_map = {'single': 0, 'divorced': 1, 'married': 2}
df['marital_score'] = df['marital'].map(marital_map)
Use with cautionâ€”only if supported by domain logic or target association.

6. ðŸ“Š Deposit Rate Annotation
Create a feature that maps each marital status to its observed deposit rate (from EDA)

python
deposit_rates = df.groupby('marital')['deposit'].mean().to_dict()
df['marital_deposit_rate'] = df['marital'].map(deposit_rates)
This embeds historical performance directly into the feature.

ðŸ§© Stakeholder Notes to Capture
Insight	Note
Distribution	% of each marital status
Deposit Rate	Which group converts better
Encoding Strategy	One-hot vs. binary grouping
Interaction Potential	Combine with job, education, or month
Business Framing	Financial stability, independence, campaign timing relevance
